Some known issues w/ code + hardware :
- when halfway between on/off the software always pulls up
	- half push of a button will continuously "press" the button
	- halfway between rotary encoder position, software thinks it keeps turning
- when checking one input, the other input can still set off the checkAction
	- seemingly randomly the rotary encoder will set off the button press
	- a button press will increase the rotary "loading" by about 25% but sometimes not that
- upon startup, odd text will be spit out by the serial display before "Start!"
